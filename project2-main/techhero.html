            <p><strong>(December 1, 1940 – April 9, 2011)</strong></p>
            <p>Gerald Anderson Lawson was an American electronic engineer and a pioneering figure in the history of video games. As one of the first African-American computer engineers in Silicon Valley, Lawson broke barriers and set a foundation for future generations in tech. He is best known for his groundbreaking work in designing the Fairchild Channel F video game console. He led the team that developed ROM cartridges, making them a durable and reusable medium for commercial video games.</p>
            <p>Lawson's innovative work earned him the title of the "father of the game cartridge." His contributions not only shaped the video game industry but also demonstrated the impact of African-American engineers in technology. After his time at Fairchild, he went on to establish his own game company, Video-Soft, where he continued to push the boundaries of game development and engineering.</p>
