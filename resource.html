    <h2>1. Introduction to Implicit Bias</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Implicit biases, also referred to as unconscious biases, are societal stereotypes that individuals unconsciously form about groups of people, separate from their own conscious awareness. Often, individuals are not aware of their biases. Some biases may appear small but have a big impact on society. Researchers have attributed many disparities to implicit bias, like the gender pay gap, police use of force on communities of color, and health disparities. Alongside institutional structures and policies, many scholars say employees’ implicit biases can contribute to instances of discrimination and racism in the workplace. As a result, many Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) practitioners have sought solutions to reduce implicit biases in individuals.</p>

    <h2>2. Understanding the Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview of IBT:</strong> The Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures the strength of associations between concepts and evaluations or stereotypes to reveal an individual’s hidden or subconscious biases. This test was first published in 1998 by Project Implicit, and has since been continuously updated and enhanced. Project Implicit was founded by Tony Greenwald of the University of Washington, Mahzarin Banaji of Harvard University, and Brian Nosek of the University of Virginia. Project Implicit is a non-profit organization aimed at educating the public about hidden biases and providing a “virtual laboratory” for collecting data on the Internet.</p>
