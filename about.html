        <p>I'm a senior at UW-Madison majoring in Information Science with certificates in Digital Studies and Science Communication. I’m also a member of the Wisconsin Alumni Student Board (WASB) on campus. This past summer, I interned in Tanzania with the Foundation for Improving Education Outcomes of Needy Students. I built digital tools for local schools and learned about the unique challenges and opportunities in tech adoption in East Africa.</p>
        <p>Currently, I work as the Web Marketing Assistant for UW-Madison’s Interdisciplinary Professional Program in the College of Engineering, where I focus on optimizing their website and digital marketing strategies. My experiences have given me a global perspective on how technology can drive solutions to real-world challenges. In the future, I hope to continue traveling and to pursue a career in UX design!</p>
